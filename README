Version 1.4: 
- Auction occurs when a player decides not to buy a property they land on. 
- Computer player will bid in an auction if it has enough money and the property is being sold for less than 85% of its value

Version 1.3:
- Players can mortgage properties they own (must sell houses) and can later unmortgage.
- At the start of a turn, a player can initiate a trade of a property and/or money with another player. The second player must confirm the trade before it takes place.
- Computer players are an available option. The game can be played with 0-4 computer players. Computer players can respond to trade requests.
- Bugs include: Players exit game when they run out of cash (even if they still could mortgage properties, sell houses, etc)

Version 1.2:
 - Players can now buy houses if they own all properties from a given category (color).
 - Property viewer/ house buying menu available for each player, graphically see which properties are owned by that player.
 - When a Community Chest/Chance card move a player to a new space, action is taken at that space.
 - Rolling doubles 3 times in a row sends a player immediately to jail.

Version 1.1:
 - All spaces on the board are functional, including jail (NOTE: rolling doubles 3 times in a row does not send a player to jail).
 - A limited set of Community Chest and Chance cards are available.
 - All rents are correct (ie. doubled when a player owns all of one color).
