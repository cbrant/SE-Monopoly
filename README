Version 1.1:
 - All spaces on the board are functional, including jail (NOTE: rolling doubles 3 times in a row does not send a player to jail).
 - A limited set of Community Chest and Chance cards are available.
 - All rents are correct (ie. doubled when a player owns all of one color).

Version 1.2:
 - Players can now buy houses if they own all properties from a given category (color).
 - Property viewer/ house buying menu available for each player, graphically see which properties are owned by that player.
 - When a Community Chest/Chance card move a player to a new space, action is taken at that space.
 - Rolling doubles 3 times in a row sends a player immediately to jail.
